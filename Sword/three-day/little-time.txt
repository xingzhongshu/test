so many¡­¡­
so little time¡­¡­

a butterfly from ancient,follow the sunflower.
when a seed located in sweet ground,here are full of life.
the water bit by bit,the sunshine silk by silk.
blossom flower falls,fly in fly return home.

a rabbit from Grimm,ate up the cabbage.
go into the garden,do not drive the little fairy.
sit on my tail and go with me to my rabbit-hutch.
the cutey have kindly sky,every rise meaning happy day.
