Dear white，
　　something you got to know.
　　When I was born，I was black.
　　When I grow up，I am black.
　　When I＇m under the sun，I＇m black.
　　When I＇m cold，I＇m black.
　　When I＇m afraid，I＇m black.
　　When I＇m sick，I＇m black.
　　When I die，I＇m still black.
　　You——white people，
　　When you were born，
　　you were pink.
　　When you grow up，
　　you become white.
　　You＇re red under the sun.
　　You＇re blue when you＇re cold.
　　You are yellow
　　when you＇re afraid.
　　You＇re green when you＇re sick.
　　You＇re gray when you die.
　　And you，call me“color”?

My dear friend,There are nice time,ode to joy
